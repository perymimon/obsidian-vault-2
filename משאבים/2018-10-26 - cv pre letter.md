JavaScript Master. with a state of art solutions that build just with a little bit of js dust. I am passionate about JS, HTML, CSS, nodeJS and the endless solutions that can be created with them today.

Always happy to quickly build new solid infrastructures that will drive and powerup all level of employees in the company and their customers include other developers in the team.

Also,  I'm in a long quest to find the right way to build a simple&intuitive UI for complex big data web application and eager to learn from the masters.

After some years with Angular 1.5 and pure JS, and build bigs and small enterprise UI products  I'm looking to go deep with VueJs and shape my skills in the nodeJS field and the knowledge of his design-pattern
