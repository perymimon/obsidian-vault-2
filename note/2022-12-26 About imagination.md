# About Imagination

#טקסט-שכתבתי/הגיג [[2022-12-26]]
There is a problem, the brain is an emulator tool that can simulate reality: Among other things, it can moving consciousness in space or in the time ( past and future ) .

the brain's capacity is to act as an emulator, simulating reality and driving consciousness through time, both into **past** and **future**. This ability, often referred as the power of imagination or הכח המדמה in Hebrew, is a potent attribute that sets humans apart from most animals.

However, imagination is an internal force. So that you can use it to advance the world and not just go crazy you need an output to communicate its inner workings.
	
Like the text I am writing now which is the output of my thought.

The problem arises because the brain processes thought simultaneously, while most forms of communication, including speech, writing, and manual actions, are inherently serial.That is, it happens step by step. This compels us to condense or shrink our thoughts into a linear format.

Furthermore in reality the brain is a number of smaller physical minds with fast communication between them. Consequently, when controlling the body, decisions must be made regarding which action to prioritize, as it's impossible to execute everything simultaneously, as is often the case in the mind.

In the bright side teamwork can be leveraged to achieve parallelism in practical work. However, efficient and fast communication is vital to make this a reality.

Thoughts on communication:
Communication is the transfer of information from an emitting party (in rate X) to a receiving party (in rate Y). I'm personally trying to improve the reception rate on the Y side. And that's why I spends time cleaning this text.

So, is there any quick way to make Y side get our ideas fast?
we can : 	
- Use Fewer words in clean order. 
- reduce the inforamtion in the preword, and give it later after Y get some context
	-  in text we use titles to give context
- Showing a Clear pictures (art in itself)
- Put 3D physical elements in the real space, to demonstrate
	- For example, cars are designed with clay before going to the computer to design the parts
