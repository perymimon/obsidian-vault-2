# The Killers | Somebody Told Me

Breakin' my back just to know your name  
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game.  
A breakin' my back just to know your name.  
But heaven ain't close in a place like this  
Anything goes but don't blink, you might miss.  
Cuz heaven ain't close in a place like this.  
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this  
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight.  
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my whole life.  
	
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
It's not confidential, I've got potential.  
	
Ready lets roll onto something new.  
Takin' it's toll then I'm leaving without you.  
Cuz heaven ain't close in a place like this.  
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this  
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight.  
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my whole life.  
	
Somebody told me that you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
It's not confidential, I've got potential.  
	
Pace yourself for me. I said maybe, baby, please.  
But I just don't know now. When all I wanna do is try.  
	
Somebody told me that you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
It's not confidential, I've got potential a rushing and rushing around.
