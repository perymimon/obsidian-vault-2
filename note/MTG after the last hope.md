It was hopeless. the fight take forever and the green army just become bigger and bigger, the last shield's guard was exhausting. that last attack was crud and the The-Righteous magician left with just 1 point of life.  death looks invariable.

He find new source that pop to his mind but that was nothing. last move before all his ppls will vanish from history. final move.. what can one source do that can change something... he thinking ...
Where is the Fucking help they promised...

He was strong but not enough,  after all of these hours Death will be inevitable. What a waste. From the height of his knees, he looks over the horizon to the point of the new source looking for answers.

 Wait, what is there...  above that point shadow covers the sky just being his opponent's army, and a huge dragon flows out from the portal. "Fuck that his UGIN. late as usual".  He gave himself a sad smile "but this time is too late"

With the all Mana he could gathering he fires up to UGIN one-word:  "HELP" fucking help!

UGIN got his message and looks around perceives the situation, and at the speed of a blink of an eye became to a gray ball of energy that shoot down covered everything and turned all the armies in the field to dust.  UGIN Keeps his promise to us. Even at the cost of his life.

"That really happen"? ask son his father.
"This is the story they tell happened here anyway ..." Said his father to his son as they plowed the field and waved to the young griffons in the sky
