  The casual game market continues to expand, and with the use of Flash growing
  and the increased popularity of the iPhone and other mobile gaming devices,
  developers have an exciting new route to market. But many of these budding
  game programmers find that they're missing the core math and physics skills
  they need to develop even simple games. Mathematics and Physics for
  Programmers (Second Edition) teaches beginning game programmers they skills
  they need to develop causal games. Beginning with the basic aspects of
  mathematics and physics that are relevant to games, and moving on to more
  complex topics, the book combines theory and practice and the reader develops
  a number of games throughout the course of the book. With the concepts and
  techniques presented in the book, readers should be able to program a number
  of standard casual game types, including Mario-style platformers, driving
  simulations, puzzle games, and a simple first-person shooter. They will also
  gain a basic understanding of 2D and 3D geometry.
