  Twenty years ago, Terry Brooks turned fantasy fiction on its head with The
  Sword of Shannara, the first fantasy novel to make the mainstream bestseller
  lists, and the first in an unbroken string of thirteen bestselling books. Now,
  in Running with the Demon, Brooks does nothing less than revitalize fantasy
  fiction again, inventing the complex and powerful new mythos of the Word and
  the Void, good versus evil still, but played out in the theater-in-the-round
  of the "real world" of our present.  
    
  On the hottest Fourth of July weekend in decades, two men have come to
  Hopewell, Illinois, site of a lengthy, bitter steel strike. One is a demon,
  dark servant of the Void, who will use the anger and frustration of the
  community to attain a terrible secret goal. The other is John Ross, a Knight
  of the Word, a man who, while he sleeps, lives in the hell the world will
  become if he fails to change its course on waking. Ross has been given the
  ability to see the future. But does he have the power to change it?  
    
  At stake is the soul of a fourteen-year-old girl mysteriously linked to both
  men. And the lives of the people of Hopewell. And the future of the country.
  This Fourth of July, while friends and families picnic in Sinnissippi Park and
  fireworks explode in celebration of freedom and independence, the fate of
  Humanity will be decided . . .  
    
  A novel that weaves together family drama, fading innocence, cataclysm, and
  enlightenment, Running with the Demon will forever change the way you think
  about the fantasy novel. As believable as it is imaginative, as wondrous as it
  is frightening, it is a rich, exquisitely-written tale to be savored long
  after the last page is turned.
