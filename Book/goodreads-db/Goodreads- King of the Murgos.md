  In this second book of The Malloreon, Garion and Ce'nedra continue the quest
  begun in Guardians of the West. In their party travel the immortal Belgarath
  the Sorcerer, his daughter Polgara the Sorceress, and the little Drasnian,
  Silk.  
    
  Garion knows that it is the mysterious figure Zandramas who is responsible for
  the abduction of his infant son, and he and his companions journey many miles
  and encounter many strange beings in their search for him.  
    
  Their way leads through the foul swamps of Nyissa, ruled over by the
  Snake-Queen, and on into the dark kingdom of the Murgos, where human
  sacrifices are still made to the dead god Torak. Further on, however, even
  beyond those forbidding lands, they must face the ultimate danger - not only
  to themselves but to all mankind...
