  When a passenger check-in desk at London's Heathrow Airport disappears in a
  ball of orange flame, the explosion is deemed an act of God. But which god,
  wonders holistic detective Dirk Gently? What god would be hanging around
  Heathrow trying to catch the 3:37 to Oslo?  
    
  And what has this to do with Dirk's latest—and late—client, found only this
  morning with his head revolving atop the hit record "Hot Potato"?  
    
  Amid the hostile attentions of a stray eagle and the trauma of a very dirty
  refrigerator, super-sleuth Dirk Gently will once again solve the mysteries of
  the universe...
