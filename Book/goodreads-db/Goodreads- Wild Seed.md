  Doro is an entity who changes bodies like clothes, killing his hosts by reflex

  who can absorb bullets and heal with a kiss and savage anyone who threatens
  her. She fears no one until she meets Doro. Together they weave a pattern of
  destiny (from Africa to the New World) unimaginable to mortals.
