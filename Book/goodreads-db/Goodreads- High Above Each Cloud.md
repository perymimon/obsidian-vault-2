  Sun and Moon have started pouting, she is yelling, he is shouting,both declare
  and both protest, "I'm the one who's loved the best!""Tonight," Sun so boldly
  claims, "no one will take out my flames.I will shine all through the night;
  then you'll see that I am right.But if I'm wrong, I'll be a wreck; to the
  stars I'll have to trek. The skies will have just one sole a lonely moon, a
  darkened bright."
