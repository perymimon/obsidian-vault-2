  BASH Guide contains everything you need to know about Bash scripting, whether
  you are diving in for the first time, or are a seasoned pro.  
    
  No matter if you use Linux, Unix, Mac, Cygwin on Windows, or are preparing to
  run Bash natively on Windows 10, shells, scripting, automation, and
  command-line problem solving is a fact of life. Though BASH Guide is focused
  on the Bourne-again shell (BASH), the concepts presented can be applied to
  virtually any shell, including Bourne (sh), Korn (ksc), C (csh), Z (zsh), and
  the tee-shell (tsch).  
    
  For those just beginning, by the end of this book you will be able to write
  shell scripts and automate tasks with ease. If you are transitioning from
  another programming language, this guide will build on your existing knowledge
  and turn you into an expert in no time. For those with experience in Bash
  scripting, the latter chapters will hone your expertise while presenting
  advanced concepts such as file descriptor duplication, process substitution,
  traps, and more.  
    
  With chapters covering everything from what a shell is (and isn't) to how to
  trap and process signals, the full gamut of Bash scripting is covered. With
  both a quick reference and detailed index included at the end, the BASH Guide
  ensures all the commands, concepts, and syntax you learned are available at a
  moment's notice.  
    
  BASH Guide's chapters, each of which contains its own host of sections, makes
  certain that no topic is left behind.
