  **The Trail of Prophecy...**  
    
  Legends told of how the evil God Torak had coveted the power of the Orb of
  Aldur, until defeated in a final battle. But prophecy spoke of a time when he
  would awake and again seek dominance over the world. Now the Orb has been
  stolen by a priest of Torak, and that time was at hand.  
    
  The master Sorcerer Belgarath and his daughter Polgara the arch-Sorceress were
  on the trail of the Orb, seeking to regain it before the final disaster. And
  with them went Garion, a simple farm boy only months before, but now the focus
  of the struggle. He has never believed in sorcery and wanted no part of it.
  Yet with every league they traveled, the power grew in him, forcing him to
  acts of wizardry he could not accept.  
    
  This continues the magnificent epic of The Belgariad, began in Pawn of
  Prophecy, set among strange lands against a background of a war of men, Kings,
  and Gods that had spanned seven thousand years - a novel of strange fate and a
  prophecy that must come true!
