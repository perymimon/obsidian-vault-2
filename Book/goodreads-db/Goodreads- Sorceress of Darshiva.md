  **The Endless Quest...**  
    
  Troubles and delays continued to mount as Garion, Belgarath, Polgara, and the
  company pursued Zandramas across the known world. Possessed by the Dark
  Destiny, she had stolen Garion's infant son for a ritual that would destroy
  all that men valued.  
    
  She was always one step ahead, taunting and spying on them, flying over in the
  form of a great dragon. Her armies, led by a Demon Lord, threatened on one
  side; on the other were the forces of Emperor Zakath, seeking to capture
  them.  
    
  Somehow, as the Seeress of Kell had warned, they had to be at the Place Which
  Is No More for the ritual at the same time as Zandramas, or face disaster. But
  where that might be they still had no clue.
