description: >-
  Garion has slain the evil God Torak and been crowned King of Riva. The
  Prophecy was fulfilled—or so it seemed. While the strange child Errand was
  growing up in the Vale of Aldur with Polgara and Durnik, showing only
  occasional flashes of inexplicable knowledge and power, Garion was learning to
  rule and to be the husband of his fiery little Queen Ce’Nedra. Eleven years
  passed.  
    
  Then suddenly the Voice of Prophecy cried out a warning: “Beware Zandramas!”
  Not even Belgarath the Sorcerer knew who or what Zandramas was. But Garion
  discovered hints in a previously obscured part of the Mrin Codex. Worse, he
  learned that the Dark Prophecy was still waging its ancient struggle against
  the Prophecy of Light. Again, great evil was brewing in the East. And again,
  Garion found himself a pawn, caught between the two ancient Prophecies, with
  the fate of the world somehow resting on him.
