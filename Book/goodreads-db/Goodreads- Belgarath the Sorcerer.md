  Bestselling authors David and Leigh Eddings welcome readers back to the time
  before The Belgariad and The Malloreon series. Join them as they chronicle
  that fateful conflict between two mortally opposed Destinies, in a monumental
  war of men and kings and Gods.  
    
  When the world was young and Gods still walked among their mortal children, a
  headstrong orphan boy set out to explore the world. Thus began the
  extraordinary adventures that would mold that youthful vagabond into a man,
  and the man into the finely honed instrument of Prophecy known to all the
  world as Belgarath the Sorcerer.  

  Then came the dark day when the Dark God Torak split the world asunder, and
  the God Aldur and his disciples began their monumental labor to set Destiny
  aright. Foremost among their number was Belgarath. His ceaseless devotion was
  foredoomed to cost him that which he held most dear--even as his loyal service
  would extend through echoing centuries of loss, of struggle, and of ultimate
  triumph.
