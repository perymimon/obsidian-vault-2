  In _Wizard's First Rule,_ Richard Cypher's world was turned upside down. Once
  a simple woods guide, Richard was forced to become the Seeker of Truth, to
  save the world from the vile dominance of Darken Rahl, the most viciously
  savage and powerful wizard the world had ever seen. He was joined on this epic
  quest by his beloved Kahlan, the only survivor among the Confessors, who
  brought a powerful but benevolent justice to the land before Rahl's evil
  scourge. Aided by Zedd, the last of the wizards who opposed Rahl, they were
  able to cast him into the underworld, saving the world from the living hell of
  life under Rahl.  
    
  But the veil to the underworld has been torn, and Rahl, from beyond the veil,
  begins to summon a sinister power more dreadful than any he has wielded
  before. Horrifying creatures escape through the torn veil, wreaking havoc on
  the unsuspecting world above.  
    
  If Rahl isn't stopped, he will free the Keeper itself, an evil entity whose
  power is so vast and foul that once freed, it can never again be contained.  
    
  Richard and Kahlan must face Rahl and the Keeper's terrible minions. But
  first, Richard must endure the ministrations of the Sisters of the Light, or
  die from the pain of magic that is his birthright and his curse. While Richard
  undertakes the arduous journey to the forbidden city of the Sisters, Kahlan
  must embark upon a long and dangerous mission to Aydindril, citadel of the old
  wizards, where she hopes to find Zedd and the help only he can lend to their
  desperate cause.  
    
  War, suffering, torture, and deceit lie in their paths, and nothing will save
  them from a destiny of violent death, unless their courage and faith are
  joined with luck and they find the elusive..._Stone of Tears_.
