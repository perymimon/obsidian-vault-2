  Book Four of The Sword of Truth returns listeners to the world of Richard
  Cypher, a simple woods guide who never dreamed he would be named the Seeker of
  Truth and become caught up in magic, war, and dangers so extraordinary that
  the fate of his entire world would hang on his actions and decisions.  
    
  The dangerous, fanatical Imperial Order, under the leadership of the power-mad
  Emperor Jagang and his multitude of demonic underlings, unleashes a deadly
  plague. To find a cure Richard Cypher and his beloved Kahlan Amnell must seek
  out the legendary Temple of the Winds, a fortress of evil sealed away for
  three thousand years. But the path of the Seeker of Truth is never an easy
  one—even if he can reach the Temple at all, there is no guarantee he'll ever
  return.
