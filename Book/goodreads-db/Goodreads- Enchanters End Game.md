  THE DRIVE OF PROPHECY  
    
  The quest was over. The Orb of Aldur was restored. And once again, with the
  crowning of Garion, there was a descendant of Riva Iron-grip to rule as
  Overlord of the West.  
    
  But the Prophecy was unfulfilled. In the east, the evil God Torak was about to
  awaken and seek dominion. Somehow, Garion had to face the God, to kill or be
  killed. On the outcome of that dread duel rested the destiny of the world.
  Now, accompanied by his grandfather, the ancient sorcerer Belgarath, Garion
  headed toward the City of Endless Night, where Torak awaited him.  
    
  To the south, his fiancée, the princess Ce'Nedra, led the armies of the West
  in a desperate effort to divert the forces of Torak's followers from the man
  she loved.  
    
  The Prophecy drove Garion on. But it gave no answer to the question that
  haunted him: How does a man kill an immortal God?
