description: >-
  She soars above a world of warriors, kings, and priests. The daughter of
  Belgarath and the shape-shifter Poledra, she has fought wars, plotted palace
  coups, and worked her powerful magic for three thousand years. Now, Polgara
  looks back at her magnificent life, in this fitting crown jewel to the saga
  that is the Eddings' Belgariad and Mallorean cycles.  
    
  Her hair streaked white by her father's first touch, her mind guided by a
  mother she will not see again for centuries, Polgara begins life in her Uncle
  Beldin's tower, and in the prehistorical, magical Tree that stands in the
  middle of the Vale. There, she first learns the reaches of her powers. There
  she assumes the bird shapes that will serve her on her adventures. And there
  she starts on the path toward her destiny as Duchess of Erat, shepherdess of
  the cause of good, adversary of Torak the One-Eyed Dragon God, and guardian of
  the world's last, best hope: the heir to the Rivan throne.  
    
  Here is the legendary life story of a woman of wit, passion, and complex
  emotions, a woman born of two majestic parents who could not have been more
  unlike one another. Ordained to make peace and make war, to gain love and lose
  love, Polgara lives out her family's rich prophecy in the ceaseless struggle
  between the Light and the Dark.  
    
  Polgara is the epic culmination of a magnificent saga, and a fitting farewell
  to a world which, once experienced, will never be forgotten.
