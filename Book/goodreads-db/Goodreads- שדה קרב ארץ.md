  In the year A.D. 3000, Earth is a dystopian wasteland, plundered of its
  natural resources by alien conquerors known as Psychlos. Fewer than
  thirty-five thousand humans survive in a handful of communities scattered
  across the face of a post-apocalyptic Earth.  

  From the ashes of humanity rises a young hero, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler. Setting
  off on an initial quest to discover a hidden evil, Jonnie unlocks the mystery
  of humanity's demise and unearths a crucial weakness in their oppressors.
  Spreading the seeds of revolt, Jonnie and a small band of survivors pit their
  quest for freedom in an all-out rebellion that erupts across the continents of
  Earth and the cosmic sprawl of the Psychlo empire.  

  For the fate of the Galaxy lies on the _Battlefield_ of _Earth_.  

  **"Pulse-pounding mile-a-minute sci-fi action adventure that does not stop. It
  is a masterpiece of popular adventure science fiction."** _\-Brandon
  Sanderson_
