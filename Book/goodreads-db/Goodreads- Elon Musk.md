  **From the author of _Steve Jobs_ and other bestselling biographies, this is
  the astonishingly intimate story of the most fascinating and controversial
  innovator of our era—a rule-breaking visionary who helped to lead the world
  into the era of electric vehicles, private space exploration, and artificial
  intelligence. Oh, and took over Twitter.**  
    
  When Elon Musk was a kid in South Africa, he was regularly beaten by bullies.
  One day a group pushed him down some concrete steps and kicked him until his
  face was a swollen ball of flesh. He was in the hospital for a week. But the
  physical scars were minor compared to the emotional ones inflicted by his
  father, an engineer, rogue, and charismatic fantasist.  
    
  His father’s impact on his psyche would linger. He developed into a tough yet
  vulnerable man-child, prone to abrupt Jekyll-and-Hyde mood swings, with an
  exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of
  mission, and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive.  
    
  At the beginning of 2022—after a year marked by SpaceX launching thirty-one
  rockets into orbit, Tesla selling a million cars, and him becoming the richest
  man on earth—Musk spoke ruefully about his compulsion to stir up dramas. “I
  need to shift my mindset away from being in crisis mode, which it has been for
  about fourteen years now, or arguably most of my life,” he said.  
    
  It was a wistful comment, not a New Year’s resolution. Even as he said it, he
  was secretly buying up shares of Twitter, the world’s ultimate playground.
  Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place, his mind went back to being
  bullied on the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground.  
    
  For two years, Isaacson shadowed Musk, attended his meetings, walked his
  factories with him, and spent hours interviewing him, his family, friends,
  coworkers, and adversaries. The result is the revealing inside story, filled
  with amazing tales of triumphs and turmoil, that addresses the are the demons
  that drive Musk also what it takes to drive innovation and progress?
