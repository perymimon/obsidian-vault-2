  Every five thousand years, a door opens between the dimensions. In one
  dimension lies the universe and all of its multitude of varied life forms.


  In another exists an element made not of earth, air, fire or water, but of an
  anti-energy, anti-life. This "thing", this darkness, waits patiently at the
  threshold of the universe for an opportunity to extinguish all life and all
  light.


  Every five thousand years, the universe needs a hero, and in New York City of
  the 23rd Century, a good hero is hard to find.


  _The Fifth Element,_ a timeless story about love and survival, heroes and
  villains, good and evil, set in a strangely familiar yet intoxicatingly
  different 23rd Century. The film stars Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm,
  Milla Jovovich. _The Fifth Element_ is written directed by Luc Besson, the
  visually innovative director of _La Femme Nikita_ and _The Professional._
