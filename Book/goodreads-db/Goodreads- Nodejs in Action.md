  **Summary**  
    
  _Node.js in Action_ is an example-driven tutorial that starts at square one
  and guides you through all the features, techniques, and concepts you'll need
  to build production-quality Node applications. You'll start by learning how to
  set up your Node development environment, including loading the
  community-created extensions. Next, you'll run several simple demonstration
  programs where you'll learn the basics of a few common types of Node
  applications. Then you'll dive into asynchronous programming, a model Node
  leverages to lessen application bottlenecks.  
    
  **About this Book**  
    
  JavaScript on the server? You bet. Node.js is a JavaScript server capable of
  supporting scalable, high-performance web applications. Using asynchronous
  I/O, the server can do more than one thing at a time, a key requirement for
  real-time apps like chat, games, and live statistics. And since it's
  JavaScript, you use the same language end to end.  
    
  _Node.js in Action_ shows you how to build production-quality applications.
  Clear introductions of key concepts and example-by-example coverage take you
  from setup to deployment. You'll dive into asynchronous programming, data
  storage, and output templating, and interact with the filesystem to create
  non-HTTP applications like TCP/IP servers and command-line tools. Perfect for
  a web developer transitioning from Rails, Django, or PHP. Requires basic
  knowledge of JavaScript. No prior experience with Node.js needed.  
    
  Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub
  formats from Manning Publications.  
    
  **What's Inside**  
    
    
  Set up Node and extensions Grok asynchronous programming and the event loop
  Examples including microblogging, IM, games, and more

  the core framework, authors **Mike Cantelon**, **Marc Harter**, **T.J.
