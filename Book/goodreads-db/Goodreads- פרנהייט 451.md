  **Ray Bradbury’s internationally acclaimed novel Fahrenheit 451 is a
  masterwork of twentieth-century literature set in a bleak, dystopian
  future.**  
    
  Guy Montag is a fireman. In his world, where television rules and literature
  is on the brink of extinction, firemen start fires rather than put them out.
  His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along
  with the houses in which they are hidden.  
    
  Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning
  each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her
  television “family.” But then he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse,
  who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present
  where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless
  chatter of television.  
    
  When Mildred attempts suicide and Clarisse suddenly disappears, Montag begins
  to question everything he has ever known. He starts hiding books in his home,
  and when his pilfering is discovered, the fireman has to run for his life.
