  With first-chapter allusions to martial arts, "flow," "mind like water," and
  other concepts borrowed from the East (and usually mangled), you'd almost
  think this self-helper from David Allen should have been called _Zen and the
  Art of Schedule Maintenance_.


  Not quite. Yes, _Getting Things Done_ offers a complete system for downloading
  all those free-floating gotta-do's clogging your brain into a sophisticated
  framework of files and action lists--all purportedly to free your mind to
  focus on whatever you're working on. However, it still operates from the
  decidedly Western notion that if we could just get really, really organized,
  we could turn ourselves into 24/7 productivity machines. (To wit, Allen, whom
  the New Economy bible _Fast Company_ has dubbed "the personal productivity
  guru," suggests that instead of meditating on crouching tigers and hidden
  dragons while you wait for a plane, you should unsheathe that high-tech saber
  known as the cell phone and attack that list of calls you need to return.)


  As whole-life-organizing systems go, Allen's is pretty good, even fun and
  therapeutic. It starts with the exhortation to take every unaccounted-for
  scrap of paper in your workstation that you can't junk, The next step is to
  write down every unaccounted-for gotta-do cramming your head onto its own
  scrap of paper. Finally, throw the whole stew into a giant "in-basket"


  That's where the processing and prioritizing begin; in Allen's system, it get
  a little convoluted at times, rife as it is with fancy terms, subterms, and
  sub-subterms for even the simplest concepts. Thank goodness the spine of his
  system is captured on a straightforward, one-page flowchart that you can pin
  over your desk and repeatedly consult without having to refer back to the
  book. That alone is worth the purchase price. Also of value is Allen's
  ingenious Two-Minute Rule: if there's anything you absolutely must do that you
  can do right now in two minutes or less, then do it now, thus freeing up your
  time and mind tenfold over the long term. It's commonsense advice so obvious
  that most of us completely overlook it, much to our detriment; Allen excels at
  dispensing such wisdom in this useful, if somewhat belabored, self-improver
  aimed at everyone from CEOs to soccer moms (who we all know are more organized
  than most CEOs to start with). --_Timothy Murphy_
