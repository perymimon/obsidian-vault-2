  A magnificent epic set against a history of seven thousand years of the
  struggles of Gods and Kings and men - of strange lands and events - of fate
  and a prophecy that must be fulfilled!  
    
  THE BELGARIAD  
    
  It had all begun with the theft of the Orb that had so long protected the West
  from the evil God Torak. Before that, Garion had been a simple farm boy.
  Afterward, he discovered that his aunt was really the Sorceress Polgara and
  his grandfather was Belgarath, the Eternal Man. Then, on the long quest to
  recover the Orb, Garion found to his dismay that he, too, was a sorcerer.  
    
  Now, at last, the Orb was regained and the quest was nearing its end. Of
  course, the questors still had to escape from this crumbling enemy fortress
  and flee across a desert filled with Murgo soldiers searching for them, while
  Grolim Hierarchs strove to destroy them with dark magic. Then, somehow, they
  must manage to be in Riva with the Orb by Erastide.  
    
  After that, however, Garion was sure that his part in these great events would
  be finished.  
    
  But the Prophecy still held future surprises for Garion - and for the little
  Princess Ce'Nedra!
