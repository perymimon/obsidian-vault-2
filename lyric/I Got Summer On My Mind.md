# I Got Summer On My Mind

I got summer on my mind  
Nowhere else though  
Lord take me downtown or to you  
People show me love but I can't take it  
What I said was true real pain, can't fake it

Still they wanna be with me  
Still they wanna live with me  
Still they wanna feel like me  
Still I can't believe it's me

Time you spend on me I spend mine on being free  
On a flight to NYC, I see you when you see me

I wonder why?  
Why you have to lie?  
When you've seen me cry  
When you've seen me shy  
When you've seen me high  
When you will see me die

Where we from, you don't know  
You will know where we will go  
Yeah I'm here, where are you?  
There's nothing we can't do  
We up in here with one thing on our mind, let's leave with something  
Then we play "Still D.R.E" my way, all day  
In Beats by Dre then we go and get buzzed  
Get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up (fucked up)

I am S-Y, no lie, at least you get to witness  
Kill so many songs, you'd think I have a hitlist  
That's Drake, well we love young money business  
'Cause we're young and we get money
