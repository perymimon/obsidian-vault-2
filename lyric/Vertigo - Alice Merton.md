[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
Hands are sweaty, my heart beats heavy
There's something out there, I swear, I'm not ready
And I don't really know where to go from here
The sound's getting louder, the floor starts shaking
Everybody's feeling it, why can't I feel it, no?
Why can't I just let it go?

[Chorus]
'Cause all I can feel is vertigo, oh-oh-oh
All I can feel is vertigo
Gotta get outta my head
Do something that I'll regret
He's dancing now with someone he met
Losing my sanity
Get rid of my vanity
All I can feel is, feel is
All I can feel is vertigo

[Verse 2]
Their faces seem deadly, it just got messy
His eyes bloodshot but he's going in steady
And I don't really know why I'm still here
And my head keeps pounding, my feet are still hurting
I think I lost sight of where I was going
And I don't really know where to go from here

[Chorus]
'Cause all I can feel is vertigo, oh-oh-oh
All I can feel is vertigo
Gotta get outta my head
Do something that I'll regret
He's dancing now with someone he met
Losing my sanity
Get rid of my vanity
All I can feel is, feel is
All I can feel is vertigo
Gotta get outta my head
Do something that I'll regret
He's dancing now with someone he met
Losing my sanity
Get rid of my vanity
All I can feel is, feel is
All I can feel is vertigo

[Bridge]
Caught inside of a dark night out
Left me standing by myself
Under your control

[Chorus]
'Cause all I can feel is vertigo
All I can feel is, feel is
All I can feel is vertigo
Gotta get outta my head
Do something that I'll regret
He's dancing now with someone he met
Losing my sanity
Get rid of my vanity
All I can feel is, feel is
All I can feel is vertigo
