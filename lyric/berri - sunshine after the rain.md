# Berri | Sunshine After The Rain

[Sunshine After The Rain - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3wJjBNoVIE)

Everywhere I go  
I see a face we used to know  
I pass a place we used to go  
when you were mine  
since you went away  
my heart's not free  
it keeps raining down on me  
will there be a day  
when the sun will shine  
I want to see the sunshine after the rain  
I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountains again  
sunshine after the rain  
oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end  
when I hear your name  
I start to cry, each day's the same since your goodbye  
it's like a game, forgetting you  
every night I pray  
tomorrow brings a sunny day and happy things  
just like the way it used to be for you and me  
I want to see the sunshine after the rain  
I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountains again  
sunshine after the rain  
oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end  
everywhere I go  
I see a face we used to know  
I pass a place we used to go  
when you were mine  
since you went away  
since you went away  
my heart's not free  
it keeps raining down on me  
will there be a day when the sun will shine  
I want to see the sunshine after the rain  
I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountains again  
sunshine after the rain  
oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end  
I want to see the sunshine after the rain  
I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountains again  
sunshine after the rain  
oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end
