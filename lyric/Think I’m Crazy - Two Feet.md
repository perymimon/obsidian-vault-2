[Intro]
Hey, you're really crazy, you know that?

[Verse 1]
I thought that I was calling up my friends now (My friends now)
But Kurt told me that they were in my head, so (In my head, so)
Do I wanna be like Leo in that movie?
Cocaine and groupies, Quaaludes and boobies

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I've got lots to do, no-no (No-no)
And I really fuck with you, oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Would you wanna stay around? I know (I know)
You know (You know)
Don't go

[Chorus]
I think I'm crazy, lately
Everything is hazy
Everything and anything I ever want to do
I think I'm crazy, lately
Feeling like I'm faded
Everywhere I go, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I need to tell you something weird about me (About me)
I like it when you tie the rope around me (Around me)
And my life has always been a little different
Since you've been in it, got double vision

[Chorus]
I think I'm crazy, lately
Everything is hazy
Everything and anything I ever want to do
I think I'm crazy, lately
Feeling like I'm faded
Everywhere I go, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
You say I'm going crazy
I'm feeling fucking lazy
You say I'm going crazy
So crazy, oh
You say I'm going crazy
I'm feeling fucking lazy
You say I'm going crazy
So crazy, ohh

[Chorus]
I think I'm crazy, lately
Everything is hazy
Everything and anything I ever want to do
I think I'm crazy, lately
Feeling like I'm faded
Everywhere I go, oh-oh, oh-oh
I think I'm crazy, lately
Everything is hazy
Everything and anything I ever want to do
I think I'm crazy, lately
Feeling like I'm faded
Everywhere I go, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
