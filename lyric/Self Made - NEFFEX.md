[Verse 1]
Growing up in cali yea you know I love the weather
Lime light hit em and you know I handle pressure
I do what I want so Im never saying never
I get what I want so they call me go getter
Yea
I know he does it good
But you know I do it better
So misunderstood
If she want it then I let her
Everybody knows
If I want her then I get her
She gave me that look
Yea she know she thinks I'm clever

[Chorus]
I don't think I do it good
No I think I do it great
They would do it if they could
They can't do it so they hate

Everybody wanna look
But nobody wanna play
Stealing eyes like a crook
While I put it in display

I don't do it by the book
No I do my own thing
That's why every single hook
Got em singing like me

And I ain't in any rush
Cuz I'm finally getting paid
Don't believe in any luck
I believe im self made yea

[Verse 2]
Catch me at the top
Sippin shots of patrone
I will never stop
Till the road is my home

I'm about to pop
Everybody's gunna know
When the beat drops
They be yelling B-Ho!

Girls in crop tops
Drop tops at our shows
Mini skirts rock
Got us all like woah

All the pretty ladies
Lined up front row
Driving me crazy
I just wanna take em home

Got it on lock
Yea u could me pro
Parties on the block
Make sure the girls know

Now it's getting hot
Up in here oh no
Think nelly had it right
Better take off all your clothes

Futures looking bright
Now I'm finally in the zone
3 years of my life
I committed to the growth

Soulja boy tell em
Number one ringtone
I'm the reason people texting
Cuz they blowing up your phone

[Chorus]
I don't think I do it good
No I think I do it great
They would do it if they could
They can't do it so they hate

Everybody wanna look
But nobody wanna play
Stealing eyes like a crook
While I put it in display

I don't do it by the book
No I do my own thing
That's why every single hook
Got em singing like me

And I ain't in any rush
Cuz I'm finally getting paid
Don't believe in any luck
I believe im self made yea
